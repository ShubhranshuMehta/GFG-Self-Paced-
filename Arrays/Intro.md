Advantages of Arrays:
	1. Random Access
	2. Cache Friendliness

Types of Arrays:
	1. Fixed Sized Arrays
	2. Dynamic Sized Arrays


How to make A Fixed Sized Array:
	int[] arr = new int[n];
	int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40}

All fixed sized arrays in java are heap allocated while in c++ some are heap and some are stack allocated.


Dynamic Sized Arrays:
	C++ : Vectors
	Java : ArrayLists
	Python : Lists

Advantages of Dynamic Sized Araays:
	1. Dynamic Size
	2. Rick Library of functions

Dynamic Arrays initially give an array of size n and whenever the number of items increases from n, they make an array of *double* the size and *copy* all the elements from the initial array.
