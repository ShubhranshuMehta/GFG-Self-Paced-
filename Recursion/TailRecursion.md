Tail Recurion

A recursive function is called tail recursion when the parent function has nothing more to do when the child function has ended
when the last thing that happens in the function is the recursive call in tail recursion

Like printing numbers from n to 1 is tail recursion while printing from 1 to n is not tail recursion

It takes less time for tail recursion and more time for those which are not tail recursion.
